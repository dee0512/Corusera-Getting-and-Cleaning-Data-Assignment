# Corusera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment

The data for the run_analysis.R script is given in the UCI HAR Dataset. 

The run_analysis.R script does the following :  
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.   
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
